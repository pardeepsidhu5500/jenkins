Jenkins agent set-up

===============================

STEPS

1. create two ec2- instances ( ubuntu )

ubuntu-24 ami
t2.micro
keypair = jenkinskey.ppk/pem
security group = new security-group ----> ssh, all traffic ( anywhere )
number of instances ---> 2 ( jenkins-master , jenkins-worker )
launch instances
2. connect jenkins-master ec2-instance and install jenkins

( follow , how to install jenkins on ubuntu machine )
3. connect jenkins-slave ec2-instance and install java

sudo apt update

sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre -y

sudo apt install docker.io -y

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

sudo reboot

4. Go to jenkins-master ec2-instance

ssh-keygen
cd .ssh
ls
cat id_rsa.pub ( copy public key )
5. Go to jenkins-slave ec2-instance

vi /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys ( paste the public key you copied from Jenkins Master )
6. Go to jenkins-master ec2-instance

ssh ubuntu@PUB-IP-SLAVE
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? ------> yes
( Now you can access the slave machine )

exit
7. Open jenkins for Setting up a Node agent

jenkins-master ec2-instance:8080

sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

install suggested plug-ins

Go to Manage Jenkins ---> nodes ---> New node ---> node name = jenkins agent ( Permanent Agent ) ----> create

description = this is jenkins agent as slave ----> Remote root directory = /home/ubuntu

Labels = jenkins agent ----> Launch method = launch agents via ssh ---> host = slave-node-pub-ip

Jenkins Credentials Provider: Jenkins

- ssh user name with pvt key
- id = key
- desc. = myslavenode1
- username = ubuntu
- pvt key = paste it ( cat id_rsa )
Host Key Verification Strategy = non verifying

Running a Pipeline Job for Nodejs App on a Jenkins Agent

In the Jenkins master server, we will define a pipeline and create a job and the execution will be on the agent instance.

Step 2: Enter the Job name "agent-project" and select Pipeline

Step 3: Give the Description and select "GitHub Project"

Step 4: In the "Project url" section copy the GitHub URL of the project repository and paste it.

https://github.com/icloudrepo1/jenkins-project-repo.git

Step 5: Scroll down to the "Pipeline" section copy this pipeline and paste it in the Pipeline script & build

follow jenkinsfile
